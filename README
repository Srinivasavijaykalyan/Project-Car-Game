# Project Car-game
Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language.

Pygame is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system.

Pygame itself has been downloaded millions of times.

Pygame is free. Released under the LGPL licence, you can create open source, freeware, shareware, and commercial games with it. 

For a nice introduction to pygame, examine the line-by-line chimp tutorial, and the introduction for python programmers. buffer, and many other different backends... including an ASCII art backend! OpenGL is often broken on linux systems, and also on windows systems - which is why professional games use multiple backends.

Multi core CPUs can be used easily. With dual core CPUs common, and 8 core CPUs cheaply available on desktop systems, making use of multi core CPUs allows you to do more in your game. Selected pygame functions release the dreaded python GIL, which is something you can do from C code.

Uses optimized C and Assembly code for core functions. C code is often 10-20 times faster than python
